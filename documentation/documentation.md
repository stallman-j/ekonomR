**ekonomR is currently (2024-09-08) being resynthesized as one package that combines workflow from start to finish plus spatial analysis, rather than two packages, one covering workflow and the other specializing in spatial analysis. We should be back with the basic start-up workflow in about a week, and the spatial functions will be brought in over the months of September and October 2024.**
